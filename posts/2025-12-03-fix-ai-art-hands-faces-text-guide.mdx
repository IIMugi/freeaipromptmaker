# Fixing the Glitches: A Human's Guide to Correcting AI Art Hands, Faces, and Text

We’ve all been there, right? You spend ages crafting the perfect prompt, hit ‘generate,’ and watch as a masterpiece slowly materializes on your screen… *almost*. The lighting is sublime, the composition is dynamic, the style is exactly what you envisioned. But then your eyes catch it. The character has a hand that looks like a melted wax sculpture, their eyes are pointing in slightly different directions, or the text on a sign is straight-up alien script.

These classic AI art problems—mangled hands, uncanny faces, and gibberish text—are some of the most common and maddening frustrations for creators. They’re the final, tiny hurdles that separate a pretty good generation from a true masterpiece.

But why do even the most advanced AI models like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, and Stable Diffusion still get tripped up by these specific details? And more importantly, what can we actually do about it?

This guide is all about practical, actionable strategies to tackle these three big challenges. We'll cover everything from clever prompting tricks to post-generation surgery, helping you get way more control and polish on your final images.

### 1. So, Why *Does* AI Struggle with Hands, Faces, and Text?

Before we dive into the fixes, it helps to understand what’s going on under the hood. It’s not that the AI is “lazy” or just bad at its job. The issue lies in how it learned about our world.

*   **The Hand Conundrum:** Let's be real, hands are incredibly complex. They have 27 bones, a ton of joints, and can twist into an almost infinite number of poses. In the billions of images the AI trained on, hands are often partially hidden, holding things, or blurry with motion. The AI is basically trying to piece together a puzzle with millions of incomplete pieces. This often leads to it "guessing" on the number of fingers or how a thumb should bend, giving us the infamous six-fingered hand.

*   **The Uncanny Valley of Faces:** With faces, the problem is actually *us*. Our brains are hardwired to be world-class face detectors. A tiny imperfection on a tree or a building in an AI image might go completely unnoticed, but a slightly asymmetrical eye or an unnaturally smooth smile can feel instantly wrong and creepy. This is the "uncanny valley"—that eerie feeling we get from something that looks *almost*, but not quite, human. The AI isn't necessarily worse at generating faces, but our standards for them are astronomically higher.

*   **The Text Tangle:** This one’s a bit different. Diffusion models, the tech behind most AI art generators, think in pixels and concepts, not letters and language. When you ask for the word "CAFE," the AI doesn't understand C-A-F-E. It just knows what the general *shape* of a "cafe sign" looks like from all the images it's seen. The result is often a jumbled, dream-like soup of letter-forms that looks like text but isn't.

Alright, now that we know our enemy, let's figure out how to outsmart it.

### 2. The Hand Problem: Prompting for Better Fingers and Anatomy

Ah, the six-fingered hand—the official mascot of AI art glitches. While newer models have gotten so much better, bad hands still love to crash the party. Here’s how you can minimize them with some smart prompting.

#### Strategy 1: Simplify the Pose

My first piece of advice? Don't ask for too much. The more complex the action, the more likely the AI is to get confused. Instead of asking for a wild gesture, start with something simple and clear.

*   **Avoid:** "A wizard casting a complex spell with intricate finger movements."
*   **Try:** "A wizard with hands resting on a glowing orb," or "A wizard with an open palm facing forward."

By giving the hands a simple job to do, you reduce the number of variables the AI has to juggle, which I've found really increases the success rate.

```
A stoic queen sitting on a throne, her elegant hands resting calmly on the armrests, detailed fingers, anatomically correct hands --ar 2:3 --style raw
```

#### Strategy 2: Use Descriptive Reinforcement

This might sound obvious, but sometimes you just have to spell it out for the AI. Add descriptive phrases that specifically call out the quality you want. You’re essentially tapping the model on the shoulder and saying, "Hey, pay extra attention to this part!"

Keywords to include:
*   `anatomically correct hands`
*   `perfectly formed hands`
*   `detailed fingers`
*   `five fingers`
*   `elegant hands`

```
Closeup portrait of a master watchmaker inspecting a tiny gear, holding it delicately between her thumb and forefinger, perfectly formed hands with detailed fingers, macro photography, soft studio lighting --ar 16:9
```

#### Strategy 3: Leverage Negative Prompts

Negative prompts are your best friend for cleaning up recurring problems. By telling the model exactly what you *don't* want, you can steer it away from making those classic mistakes. This is super powerful in Stable Diffusion but also works great with Midjourney's `--no` parameter.

Common negative prompts for hands:
*   `--no deformed hands, mutated hands, extra fingers, fused fingers, malformed`
*   For Stable Diffusion: `(bad hands:1.2), (six fingers:1.2), ugly, disfigured, poorly drawn hands`

```
A young woman holding a single red rose, her hands are beautiful and clearly visible, soft focus background, golden hour lighting, 35mm film photo --ar 4:5 --no extra fingers, deformed hands, fused fingers, ugly hands
```

#### Strategy 4: Use Props and Context

I've found that giving hands a simple, clear object to interact with can ground them in reality. The AI has seen countless photos of hands holding mugs, books, or phones, so using these contexts gives it a much stronger and more reliable reference point.

```
Overhead shot of a writer's desk, a person's hands are wrapped around a warm ceramic mug of coffee, steam rising, cozy atmosphere, detailed fingers, morning light --ar 3:2
```

It’s all about guiding the AI toward a solution it already knows how to execute well.

### 3. Fixing Faces: Escaping the Uncanny Valley

Nothing tanks a great image faster than a distorted face. The key to getting better faces is to guide the AI toward natural expressions and features, steering clear of that dreaded uncanny valley.

#### Strategy 1: Focus on Emotion and Expression

Instead of just describing a "woman's face," try describing her state of mind. Giving the AI emotional cues provides a much stronger, more human context to work from, which often leads to more natural-looking results.

*   **Instead of:** `A portrait of a woman.`
*   **Try:** `A portrait of a woman with a gentle, serene smile, her eyes filled with warmth and kindness.`

This subtle shift encourages the AI to create a face that feels emotionally whole, and that coherence often translates to better anatomy.

```
Character portrait of a wise old librarian, a knowing and gentle smile on his face, crinkles around his kind eyes, soft ambient light from a reading lamp, oil painting style --ar 4:5
```

#### Strategy 2: Pull the "Camera" Back

Here's a trick I use all the time: if you're getting weirdness up close, just take a step back. The closer you zoom in on a subject, the more glaring any tiny flaw becomes.

*   **Medium Shots:** Try framing your character from the waist up. This keeps the face as the focal point but gives the AI less canvas to fill with hyper-detailed (and potentially flawed) features.
*   **Full-Body Shots:** By showing the whole character, the face becomes a smaller part of the composition. In my experience, AI models are often much more reliable when rendering smaller faces.

```
Medium shot of a confident female CEO in a modern office, leaning against her desk with a thoughtful expression, symmetrical face, clear eyes, cinematic lighting --ar 16:9 --style raw
```

#### Strategy 3: Specify Symmetry and Clarity

Just like with hands, you can add reinforcing keywords to your prompt to nudge the AI in the right direction. For faces, I like to focus on symmetry and well-defined features.

Keywords to include:
*   `symmetrical face`
*   `perfectly aligned features`
*   `clear, detailed eyes`
*   `natural expression`

```
cinematic headshot of a handsome sci-fi hero, strong jawline, symmetrical face, clear detailed blue eyes, determined expression, dramatic lighting --ar 2:3
```

#### Strategy 4: Use Strong Negative Prompts

A well-crafted negative prompt can be an absolute lifesaver for faces. Don't be shy—be specific about the problems you want to stamp out.

Common negative prompts for faces:
*   `--no distorted face, asymmetrical eyes, crooked mouth, weird teeth, disfigured`
*   For Stable Diffusion: `(ugly:1.3), (malformed features:1.2), (asymmetry:1.1), poorly drawn face, mutated`

```
A beautiful elven princess with long silver hair, photorealistic, intricate details, symmetrical face, ethereal glow --ar 9:16 --no ugly, distorted features, asymmetrical eyes, disfigured
```

### 4. Tackling Gibberish: How to Get Legible Text in Your AI Art

Okay, let's talk about the final boss of AI art glitches: text. Getting crisp, correct text is maybe the hardest challenge of all. Models like DALL-E 3 and Ideogram have made huge progress, but it can still be a roll of the dice. Here’s a realistic way to approach it.

#### Strategy 1: Keep It Simple and Bold

Your best bet is to ask for short, common words in simple, bold fonts.

*   **Works better:** `A neon sign that says "OPEN"`
*   **Often fails:** `A handwritten cursive letter with a long, poetic sentence.`

Think like a designer: logos, signs, and single-word statements are your friends. I've also found that putting the text you want in quotation marks can really help models like DALL-E 3 understand the goal.

```
A minimalist movie poster for a film called "ECHO", bold sans-serif typography, the word "ECHO" is centered in white against a black background, cinematic --style raw
```

#### Strategy 2: Specify the Style of Typography

Instead of just hoping for good text, give the AI a specific typographic style to work with. This provides a much stronger visual anchor for it to build from.

*   `vintage letterpress typography`
*   `bold, modern sans-serif font`
*   `8-bit pixelated text`
*   `glowing neon lettering`

```
A wooden sign on a quaint bakery shop, the sign says "PIE" in charming, rustic, hand-painted lettering, morning light, shallow depth of field
```

#### Strategy 3: The Hybrid Approach (Generate a Space)

Honestly, this is the pro move. In my experience, fighting with an AI to get complex text *just right* is often a losing battle. The best and most reliable solution is to prompt it to create a beautiful design with a *blank space* where your text should go. Then, you can pop the image into a tool like Photoshop, Affinity Photo, or even Canva and add the text yourself.

This gives you 100% control over the font, spelling, and placement, while still letting the AI do the heavy lifting on the illustration.

```
A fantasy book cover featuring a glowing sword stuck in a stone, dramatic stormy sky, leave a large blank space at the top for the title, epic fantasy art, no text
```

### 5. Advanced Correction Tools: Playing Surgeon with Inpainting and Vary (Region)

So what happens when you've prompted perfectly, but you still get that one rogue finger or a slightly off-kilter eye? Don't throw the image away! This is where you roll up your sleeves and do a little digital surgery.

#### What are Inpainting and Vary (Region)?

These are incredible tools that let you select a specific part of your image and have the AI re-generate *only that area*. It’s like having a magic undo brush for tiny sections of your art.

*   **Inpainting:** You'll find this in Stable Diffusion interfaces (like Automatic1111 or InvokeAI) and DALL-E 3's editor. You use a brush to "mask" the problem area (like a mangled hand), write a new, super-focused prompt for just that spot, and the AI will fill it in while blending it with the rest of the image.
*   **Vary (Region):** This is Midjourney's fantastic version of inpainting. After you upscale an image, a "Vary (Region)" button appears. You can then select the flawed area and let Midjourney take another crack at it, either with or without a new prompt.

#### My Go-To Workflow for Fixing a Bad Hand:

1.  **Generate Your Image:** Start with your main prompt. Let's say you get a great portrait, but the hand is a total mess.
2.  **Select the Tool:** Upscale the image in Midjourney and hit **Vary (Region)**, or open your image in an editor with an inpainting feature.
3.  **Mask the Area:** Carefully draw a selection over the entire bad hand. A little tip: it’s often better to mask a slightly larger area than just the flaw itself. This gives the AI more room to blend the new part in seamlessly.
4.  **Write a Hyper-Specific Prompt:** This is the most crucial step. Your new prompt should *only* describe what you want in the little box you just drew.
    *   **Main Prompt:** `A portrait of a king on a throne...`
    *   **Inpainting Prompt:** `A perfectly formed male hand with five fingers, resting on a golden armrest.`
5.  **Iterate:** Generate the new section. It might not be perfect on the first try, and that's okay! Don't be afraid to undo, adjust your selection, or tweak your inpainting prompt and try again. I can usually get a perfect result in just a few tries.

Here are a couple of other examples of inpainting prompts I'd use:

```
// Inpainting prompt for fixing eyes in a portrait
A pair of symmetrical, clear, detailed green eyes looking directly at the camera.
```

```
// Inpainting prompt for correcting a sign in a street scene
A red rectangular sign with the word "STOP" in clean, white, sans-serif font.
```

By mastering these prompting strategies and getting comfortable with post-generation tools, you can move past the common glitches and start producing consistently polished, high-quality AI art. It's a process of guiding, correcting, and refining—transforming you from a mere prompt writer into a true AI art director. Now go fix those hands! 🎨
